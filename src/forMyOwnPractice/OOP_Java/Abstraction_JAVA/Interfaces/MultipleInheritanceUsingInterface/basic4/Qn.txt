Create three interfaces: Readable, Writable, and Storable. Each interface should have one method
Readable with read(), Writable with write(), and Storable with store(). Then
create a class file that implements all three interfaces. Provide implementations
for all three methods in the File class. In the main method , create an object of the File class and call all three methods.
